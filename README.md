## Hi there 👋

My name's Aaron, and I write things for GitHub. 

- 🗺️ I live in Austin, TX
- 🥯 I grew up in New Jersey (but most of my family lives abroad these days in the UK and Belgium) 
- 💬 Ask me about anything music related. I'm an avid songwriter, and have been in a recording studio or three. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I helped record the theme song for Pretty Little Liars when I was 18. Fun times.
